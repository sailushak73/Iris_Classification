# Iris_Classification
A simple machine learning project to classify iris flowers using multiple models like KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project to classify iris flowers into different species using the famous Iris dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width  
The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be:
- setosa
- versicolor
- virginica

The dataset file `iris.csv` is included in this repository.

## ðŸ“Š Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

These models are trained and evaluated to classify iris flowers based on their features.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook file `IrisClassification.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to explore the data, train models, and see predictions.
